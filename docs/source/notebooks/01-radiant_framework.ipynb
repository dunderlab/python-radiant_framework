    "# Radiant Framework Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiant Framework offers two distinct operational modes for building web applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface Mode**: A modern approach for creating single-page applications (SPAs) entirely in Python, where the application runs completely in the browser using Brython. This mode enables real-time updates, client-side state management, and seamless user interactions without page reloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multipage Mode**: A traditional web development approach that uses decorator-based routing to build multi-page applications. This mode follows conventional web patterns with distinct URL-based navigation, server-side processing, and page-to-page transitions.\n"

    "## Interface Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface Mode is Radiant's approach to building modern single-page applications (SPAs) entirely in Python. In this mode, your application runs completely in the browser, leveraging Brython to execute Python code directly in the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Interface Mode:\n",
    "- Your entire application operates within a single page\n",
    "- Python code is translated to JavaScript and runs in the browser\n",
    "- DOM manipulation is handled directly through Python\n",
    "- Real-time updates occur without page reloads\n",
    "- State is managed client-side\n",
    "- Server communication happens through WebSocket or HTTP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface Mode is ideal for:\n",
    "- Real-time dashboards and monitoring applications\n",
    "- Interactive web applications\n",
    "- Single-page applications (SPAs)\n",
    "- Data visualization tools\n",
    "- Applications requiring immediate user feedback\n",
    "- Complex user interfaces with dynamic content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Interface Mode application consists of these key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RadiantInterfaceApp Class**: The main application class that inherits from `RadiantInterfaceApp`\n",
    "2. **on_mount Method**: The entry point where you define your initial UI\n",
    "3. **Event Handlers**: Methods that respond to user interactions\n",
    "4. **State Management**: Properties and methods for managing application state\n",
    "5. **Template Structure**: HTML template defining the application's layout\n",

    "## Multipage Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Multipage Mode in Radiant allows you to build traditional web applications with multiple pages and URL routing. This mode uses a decorator-based approach to define routes and handle different URLs, similar to other Python web frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of Multipage Mode:\n",
    "- Routes are defined using decorators (@AppRouter.get_route)\n",
    "- Each route corresponds to a different URL path\n",
    "- Pages are loaded through server requests\n",
    "- Supports both GET and POST methods\n",
    "- Enables traditional web navigation patterns\n",
    "- Maintains separate view functions for different pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Multipage Mode is particularly suitable for:\n",
    "- Traditional website structures with multiple pages\n",
    "- Content-heavy websites\n",
    "- Blog platforms and CMS systems\n",
    "- Documentation sites\n",
    "- E-commerce platforms\n",
    "- Applications requiring SEO optimization\n",
    "- Sites with distinct URL-based navigation\n",
    "- Forms and data submission workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multipage Mode application structure consists of these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AppRouter**: The main class for handling routes\n",
    "2. **Route Decorators**: @AppRouter.get_route and @AppRouter.post_route\n",
    "3. **View Functions**: Python functions that handle specific routes\n",
    "4. **URL Patterns**: Path definitions that map to view functions\n",

    "## Choosing the Right Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiant offers two distinct modes of operation: Interface Mode and Multipage Mode. Understanding their differences and use cases is crucial for choosing the right approach for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Mode vs Multipage Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare both modes across key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Interface Mode | Multipage Mode |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Page Loading | Single page load, dynamic content updates | Traditional page reloads |\n",
    "| State Management | Client-side state, persistent across views | Server-side state management |\n",
    "| Navigation | In-memory routing, no page refresh | URL-based routing with page loads |\n",
    "| Performance | Faster after initial load | Quicker initial page load |\n",
    "| SEO | Requires additional configuration | Better natural SEO support |\n",
    "| Development Style | Component-based, reactive | Route-based, traditional |\n",
    "| User Experience | Smoother transitions, app-like feel | Traditional web experience |\n",
    "| Browser Load | Heavier initial load | Lighter per-page load |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Interface Mode when:**\n",
    "- Building interactive dashboards or tools\n",
    "- Creating applications with frequent data updates\n",
    "- Developing complex user interfaces\n",
    "- Requiring real-time features\n",
    "- Building applications that feel like desktop apps\n",
    "- Managing complex client-side state\n",
    "- Prioritizing smooth user experiences\n",
    "- Working with WebSocket connections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Multipage Mode when:**\n",
    "- Building content-focused websites\n",
    "- Requiring optimal SEO performance\n",
    "- Creating traditional web applications\n",
    "- Developing blog or CMS platforms\n",
    "- Working with form-heavy applications\n",
    "- Building documentation sites\n",
    "- Requiring simple server-side routing\n",
    "- Needing lighter initial page loads\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider mixing both modes when:**\n",
    "- Different sections of your site have different needs\n",
    "- Some parts require real-time updates while others are static\n",
    "- Building a hybrid application (e.g., documentation with interactive examples)\n",
    "- Needing to balance SEO with interactivity"
