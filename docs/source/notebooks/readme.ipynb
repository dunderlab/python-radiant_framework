    "## Overview\n",
    "Radiant Framework is a novel web framework designed to leverage the capabilities of [Brython](https://brython.info/), a browser-based Python implementation. This innovative approach allows developers to write web applications entirely in Python, bypassing the conventional requirements of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for frontend development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python-Centric Development\n",
    "- **Unified Language Usage**: Write your entire web application using Python, ensuring a consistent and streamlined coding experience.\n",
    "- **Brython Integration**: Utilizes Brython for executing Python code in the browser, enabling a seamless transition of server-side code to client-side execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server and Browser Compatibility\n",
    "- **Dual Environment Execution**: Radiant enables the same application code to run both on the server and in the browser, maximizing code reusability and efficiency.\n",
    "- **Tornado Web Server**: On the server-side, Radiant harnesses the [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/) web server to deploy applications, known for its scalability and non-blocking network I/O capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Management\n",
    "- **Static File Handling**: Simplifies the management of static files (images, stylesheets, etc.), by setting up a local path for their serving, facilitating their inclusion in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime Configuration\n",
    "- **Dynamic HTML Templates**: Radiant offers a custom HTML template system, configurable at runtime, to dynamically import server-side scripts into the browser environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- **Streamlined Development Process**: By unifying the development language and environment, Radiant significantly reduces the complexity and learning curve associated with traditional web development.\n",
    "- **Code Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for writing separate frontend and backend code, leading to more maintainable and concise codebases.\n",
    "- **Focus on Quality**: Developers can concentrate on crafting high-quality Python code, without the distractions of dealing with various web technologies."
